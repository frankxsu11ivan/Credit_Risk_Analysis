Using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, the goal is to evaluate three machine 
learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. 

Using the information provided in the code, the training and target  code variables are completed the following steps:

###Create the training variables by converting the string values into numerical ones using the get_dummies() method.
###Create the target variables.
###Check the balance of the target variables.

Using these algorithms: 
###resample the dataset via Naive Random Oversampling,
###train a logistic regression classifier, 
###calculate the balanced accuracy score, 
###generate a confusion matrix, 
###and generate a classification report.
