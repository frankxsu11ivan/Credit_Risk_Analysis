Using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, the goal is to evaluate three machine 
learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. 

Using the information provided in the code, the training and target  code variables are completed the following steps:

###Create the training variables by converting the string values into numerical ones using the get_dummies() method.
###Create the target variables.
###Check the balance of the target variables.

Using these algorithms: 
###resample the dataset, 
###view the count of the target classes, 
###train a logistic regression classifier, 
###calculate the balanced accuracy score, 
###generate a confusion matrix, 
###and generate a classification report.


First, oversampling RandomOverSampler
Second, SMOTE algorithms
Third, undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm. 

Deliverable 1
###Use the LogisticRegression classifier to make predictions and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
###Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
###Generate a confusion matrix.
###Print out the imbalanced classification report.

Deliverable 2
The combinatorial SMOTEENN algorithm does the following:
###An accuracy score for the model is calculated 
###A confusion matrix has been generated 
###An imbalanced classification report has been generated 

Deliverable 3
